## Contents

The repository is organized into two main sections:

### Short Questions (1 Mark Each)

Each question in this section addresses a foundational concept or common operation in data analysis. These include creating data structures, handling missing values, merging and concatenating datasets, and basic plotting techniques in Matplotlib. Solutions are concise, making it easy to understand essential data science concepts. Examples of topics covered:

- **DataFrame Creation:** How to create a DataFrame from a dictionary.
- **Basic Data Analysis:** Methods for checking and handling missing values.
- **Data Manipulation:** Concatenation and merging techniques with Pandas.
- **Plot Customization:** Commands for line color, thickness, and style in Matplotlib.
- **Saving and Exporting Plots:** Saving plots in various formats with customization options.

### Broad Questions

This section dives deeper into practical applications of data science, often requiring multiple steps to complete. Each solution demonstrates a more complex problem-solving approach, integrating various skills in data preparation, visualization, and model evaluation. Some of the questions include:

1. **Dataset Concatenation and Joining:**
   - Combining datasets with different join types (inner, outer) using Pandas.
   - Merging datasets based on shared columns and understanding join types.

2. **NumPy Array Operations:**
   - Concatenating arrays and understanding dimensional consistency.

3. **Data Grouping and Aggregation:**
   - Grouping data by categories and calculating total or average values.
   - Filtering and querying data with conditions.

4. **Plotting Trigonometric Functions with Customization:**
   - Line and scatter plots with custom labels, colors, and error bars.
   - Saving complex figures with multiple subplots.

5. **Data Imputation and Cross-Validation:**
   - Handling missing values and implementing K-Fold Cross-Validation for model evaluation.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` for model optimization.

6. **Product Sales and Customer Analysis:**
   - Creating visualizations for sales and customer data, including bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots.
   - Analyzing data distribution and percentage breakdowns with visualizations like pie charts and histograms.
